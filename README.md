# Dog Breed Classifier

## Goal
- Create a Neural Network model that able to predict Dog breed based on sample images
- Develop a simple web application where user can upload an image and receive predictions

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

## Model
You can use the Notebook and run the training and do your own training or you can download the [HDF5 file]((https://yosi1.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/models/stanford_dogs_20200307.h5)) and import directly to Tensorflow.
